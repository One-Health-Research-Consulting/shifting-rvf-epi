 * Rostal MK and Thompson PN contributed equally to this work

Data is available in the "data" folder. 
 
 * "RVFV serology in livestock sampled in 2015 and 2017 in South Africa.csv" includes data that was published in _Ngoshe et al._, 2020.
 * "Uganda_seroprev_dat.csv" includes data that was published in Tumusiime D _et al._ 2023.

Plots and tables made from these data are rendered into the output folder.

There are three code files:

 * "KZN moszzie summaries.R," which is used to make Figure 2
 * "Uganda seroprevalence estimates.R", which was used to summarise the data provided in the Uganda livestock case study
 * "shifting-rvf-epi-livestock-plots_final.R," which was used to make Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix Page 2
 * "Plot hyperendemic and epidemic plots for Figure 1.R," which was used to make the hyperendemic plot in Figure 1. Note, this is just the plotting code. The model code can be found at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15632526, which was published alongside Rostal et al. 2025.
